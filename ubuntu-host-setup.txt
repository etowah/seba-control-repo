# Instructions for an offline Ubuntu 16.04 installation 
#
# Capable of running virtual machines installed with virt-install or virt-manager
#


# Install Ubuntu 16.04 using iso setup on usb drive.  
# Partitions as shown in pic, DO NOT SETUP SWAP.  Setup a non-root-user, sdn used below and in packaged qcow. 
# node1, node2, node3 hostnames 
#
# Software to install:
# - standard system utilities
# - Virtual Machine Host
# - OpenSSH
#


# Login set passwordless sudo.  add to bottom of file!

export EDITOR=vi; visudo
...
sdn ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


# Logout/Login, verify sdn user passwordless root.  Become and stay root for duration of host configuration

sudo bash


# Setup/reconfigure host networking.  Best done via console
# Remove libvirt default networks

virsh net-destroy default
virsh net-undefine default


# Configure network and bridging needed for virtual machines
# Host specific config for interface naming.  Determine your interface names and adjust
# accordingly.  

# As an example see k8s-host-interfaces reference in seba-control-repo tarball
cat ~/seba-control-repo/mgmtvm/k8s-host-interfaces 
vi /etc/network/interfaces   # have to figure out based on oob switch vlan config and agg switch vlan config



# Apply new network config  WARNING, this can cut off your legs if /etc/network/interfaces is 
# incorrect and you are not on console!

ifdown -a; ifup -a


# Verify network connectivity.  SSH in now that host is reachable via network
# Copy over artifacts from external source/thumb drive to /home/sdn

# Extract apt-repo and seba-control-repo tarballs in /home/sdn

cd ~/
tar -zxvf apt-repo.tgz 
tar -zxvf seba-control-repo.tgz


# Install script to allow bridge traffic through iptables.  Needed as later docker install
# adds restrictive iptables rules

cp ~/seba-control-repo/mgmtvm/allow-mgmtbr.sh /usr/local/bin/
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/allow-mgmtbr.sh
/usr/local/bin/allow-mgmtbr.sh


# Replace /etc/apt/sources.list for directory based apt repo

mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.orig
echo "deb file:/home/sdn/repo xenial stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-key add /home/sdn/repo/key 
apt update


# Install virtinst and python-minimal

apt install virtinst python-minimal


# Create default libvirt vm storage pool and creat new mgmt vm.

~/seba-control-repo/scripts/create-default-pool.sh


# Reboot host and verify networking restarts properly

# Confirm host has access to pod mgmt network.  Confirm ssh access.  Also confirm libvirt vm list is empty

virsh vol-list default
virsh list --all

# At this point repeat setting up physical hosts or install the mgmtgm.  See setup-mgmtvm.txt
