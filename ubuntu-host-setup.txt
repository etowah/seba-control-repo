# Logout/Login, verify foundry user passwordless root.  Become and stay root for duration of host configuration
sudo bash

sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virt-manager virtinst python-minimal


# Setup/reconfigure host networking.
# Remove libvirt default networks
virsh net-destroy default
virsh net-undefine default


# Configure network and bridging needed for virtual machines
# Host specific config for interface naming.  Determine your interface names and adjust
# accordingly.  

# As an example see k8s-host-interfaces reference in seba-control-repo tarball
cat ~/seba-control-repo/offline-setup/mgmtvm/k8s-host-interfaces 
vi /etc/network/interfaces   # have to figure out based on oob switch vlan config and agg switch vlan config


# Apply new network config  WARNING, this can cut off your legs if /etc/network/interfaces is 
# incorrect and you are not on console!
ifdown -a; ifup -a

# Create default libvirt vm storage pool and creat new mgmt vm.
~/seba-control-repo/scripts/create-default-pool.sh


# Reboot host and verify networking restarts properly

# Confirm host has access to pod mgmt network.  Confirm ssh access.  Also confirm libvirt vm list is empty
