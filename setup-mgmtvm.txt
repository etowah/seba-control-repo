# Instructions to setup a routing virtual machine providing management gateway services
#
# Routes and NAT between interior management network and exterior management network.
# Assumes no internet access.  Also provides interior management network DHCP and DNS
#

# Login to a physical host that already has libvirt and virtinst installed, networking and bridging setup
# Become root on physical host.  Import a basic ubuntu disk image and setup

sudo bash

~/seba-control-repo/scripts/vol-import.sh vnf-clone-ubuntu-1604-v3.qcow2 mgmtvm


# Verify vm running and console in.   The vm will attempt to run a dhcp client but because there is
# no server it will wait and time out after 5 minutes.

virsh list --all

# Edit the VM configuration to add the additional oambr interface.  Put above mgmtbr, example below:

virsh edit mgmtvm

    <interface type='bridge'>
      <source bridge='oambr'/>
      <model type='virtio'/>
    </interface>

    <interface type='bridge'>
      <source bridge='mgmtbr'/>
      <model type='virtio'/>
    </interface>

# Shutdown and restart VM for new interface config to take effect

virsh shutdown mgmtvm
virsh start mgmtvm
virsh autostart mgmtvm



# Console login to to newly started mgmtvm and configure networking.

virsh console mgmtvm

# if the template qcow is still booting it may be waiting for dhcp, which doesnt exist yet.
# Wait the 5 minutes and it will move on to console login

# TODO setup username/password and default networking.  Prebuild image

# Become root in mgmtvm

sudo bash

# Set hostname to mgmtvm and add other needed hosts entries.  These will become dns entries later
vi /etc/hostname

# Verify ssh access from within and outside of pod via oam network.
# Reboot VM and verify names and connectivity.  SSH login to mgmtvm/10.242.11.254

# At this point repeat setting up other physical hosts or move onto setting up seba-control-repo VM.  See setup-control-repo.txt
